Purpose: Controllers handle the business logic of your application. They receive requests from routes, interact with models to perform CRUD operations, and send responses back to the client.
Implementation: Create separate controller files corresponding to your routes. Each controller method corresponds to a specific endpoint or action (e.g., get all products, create product).
